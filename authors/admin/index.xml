      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! I am currently searching for Ph.D. positions in Electrical Engineering starting in Fall 2020. Right now I am pursuing my B.E. in Computer Engineering at Auburn University where I work as an undergraduate research assistant for Dr. Mark Adams in the STORM Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While at Auburn, I have been able to assist on many projects ranging from environmental probes to radar vulnerability testing. I am interested in studying microfabrication processes as well as quantum computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer I am in Boston as a research intern at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Here I&amp;rsquo;m analyzing the impact of large wind farms on air surveillance radar as a project from the Department of Defense. Outside of the lab I enjoy exploring the Boston area, specifically going to nearby beaches and trying as many restaurants as I can!&lt;/p&gt;
