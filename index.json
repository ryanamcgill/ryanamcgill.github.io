This is done by translating ASL to English, and then English back to ASL. Applications that are in development today try to focus on translating ASL to spoken or written English and stop there. This project is intended to \u0026lsquo;complete the circuit\u0026rsquo; by translating the non-ASL user\u0026rsquo;s response into ASL. We are proposing this idea because ASL speakers prefer to communicate in, well, ASL!\nThe two biggest challenges facing ASL translation are the lack of large datasets to train systems and unreliable language models. In this project, we propose two solutions that can help alleviate this problems and allow two-way communication for deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals.\nThis project is a part of the \u0026lsquo;Intern Innovative Idea Challenge\u0026rsquo; (I3C) that is done during the summer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

Further, we can create interesting configurations of the array for different applications.\nI am assisting a graduate student to test this design by measuring the timing charecteristics of the system. Currently the IC design is being optimized and fabricated with testing slated for Fall 2019. I have assisted in charecterizing capacitor crystals for the IC using a FieldFox Spectrum Analyze as well as designed a testing apparatus for the transmitter / receiver.
