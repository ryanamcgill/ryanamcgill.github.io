For graduate school, I am interested in working with quantum electronics, specifically with optics and photonics. This area of technology is helping usher in next generation electronics, and I want to be a part of a program that is capable of bringing this change.\nThis past summer I was in Boston as a research intern at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Here I analyzed the impact of large wind farms on air surveillance radar as a project from the Department of Defense. While there, me and a few other interns came up with a new architecture for American Sign Language translation which received laboratory funding to continue development at the university level.\nOutside of research, I give tours to prospective engineering students as well as enjoy playing board games, ranging anywhere from \u0026ldquo;Dungeons and Dragons\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;UNO\u0026rdquo;.

Thus, the whiteboard lies dormant.\nOur Proposal:\nA standard projector can be mounted on the same wall of the white board either an adjustable mount or a short-throw. A computer (such as a Raspberry Pi) will be attached to several sensors in order to create a functioning \u0026ldquo;smart board\u0026rdquo;.
