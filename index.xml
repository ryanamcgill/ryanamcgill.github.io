      <title>ENVOY: Enabling Natural-language Versatility and Opportunity</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/envoy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ENVOY is a system that will allow  natural-language communication between ASL
and non-ASL users. This is done by translating ASL to English, and then English
back to ASL. Applications that are in development today try to focus on
translating ASL to spoken or written English and stop there. This project is
intended to &amp;lsquo;complete the circuit&amp;rsquo; by translating the non-ASL user&amp;rsquo;s response
into ASL. We are proposing this idea because ASL speakers prefer to communicate
in, well, ASL!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is a part of the &amp;lsquo;Intern Innovative Idea Challenge&amp;rsquo; (I3C) that is
done during the summer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Currently the project has
passed the first round (staff voting) and is participating in the
second round (poster presentation).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wind Turbine Impact on Air Surveillance Radar (ASR)</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/windfarm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interference from wind turbines can degrade the performance of radar by providing
a large cross section and Doppler signal.  Further, wind farms generally contain
turbines that are spaced close together. All of these factors contribute to
pockets of poor radar performance near wind farms and is a concern for flight
safety.  As the investment in wind energy increases it is important to understand
the potential impact of these farms on legacy radar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HARA: Hybrid Analog-digital Retro-directive Antenna</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/retrodirective/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/retrodirective/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project&amp;rsquo;s primary objective is to create an IC capable of retro-
directive beamforming in a phased antena array system. This allows the
antenna to automatically point in the direction of the strongest signal
instead of spending time on beam steering techniques. Further, we can
create interesting configurations of the array for different applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am assisting a graduate student to test this design by measuring the
timing charecteristics of the system. Currently the IC design is being
optimized and fabricated with testing slated for Fall 2019. I have assisted
in charecterizing capacitor crystals for the IC using a FieldFox Spectrum
Analyze as well as designed a testing apparatus for the transmitter /
receiver. I was also able to begin soldering some of the components down
for one of the testing boards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Radar Vulnerability Testing</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/radar_vulnerability/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently working for the defense contractor Dynetics Inc. to investigate ways of
&amp;lsquo;hacking&amp;rsquo; an army provided phased array radar via hardware vulnerabilities. Current
tasks include emulating the radar hardware environment and investigating pathways
to attack the system, both from standoff distance and from an operational perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>eMotes: Novel Disposable Airborne Probes</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/emote/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/emote/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and GlobalSense partnered
to sponsor the eMote in order to take measurements from the atmosphere.
Data is streamed from an ensemble of sensors (up to 2080) to receivers
located on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src = &#34;/img/emote/emote.png&#34; width = &#34;1000&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system provides data on temperature, humidity, altitude, GPS, and
inertial measurements from the atmosphere. The receiver&amp;rsquo;s hardware consists
of the Tiva-C Launchpad and TI-MSP430. TI-RTOS (Texas Instruments Real-Time
Operating System) is used in order to wield excellent interrupt driven IO
from the antenna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src = &#34;/img/emote/system.png&#34; width = &#34;1000&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project has been ongoing since I have been an undergraduate at Auburn.
Currently I assist in testing the system, focussing primarily on the
receiver end of the project. We most recently concluded range and battery
testing. Future work consists of pulling wind vectors from the sensors as
well as measuring resonant frequencies of static structures.&lt;/p&gt;
