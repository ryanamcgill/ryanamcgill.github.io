      <title>QUEST: Quantum Encrypted Satellite-based Transmission</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/qkd/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a project from the Air Force University Nano-satellite Program, QUEST aims
to prove that secure communication can be realized via quantum key
distribution from a ground station to a satellite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am contributing to the payload section of the satellite. In order to achieve
quantum key distribution, the satellite&amp;rsquo;s downlink beam must be aligned with the
ground station. Currently I am designing an embedded controller to take in
camera data from the uplink and downlink beams and drive a fast steering mirror
to achieve alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Senior Design: Smith Chart</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/senior_design/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/senior_design/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For our senior design project, me and a friend proposed a project to upgrade our
beautiful Smith chart that lies on the bottom floor of Broun Hall in Auburn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Problem:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renovations done to Broun Hall included a large Smith chart on the bottom floor
of the building. Since it is printed on a marker friendly surface, it offers
utility towards struggling emag students. However, no protractor exists that is
easy to use and large enough to work with. Thus, the whiteboard lies dormant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our Proposal:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A standard projector can be mounted on the same wall of the white board either
an adjustable mount or a short-throw. A computer (such as a Raspberry Pi) will
be attached to several sensors in order to create a functioning &amp;ldquo;smart board&amp;rdquo;.
This can be realized with IR sensors, Wii remotes, and XBOX Kinects. Each
option will be evaluated to determine the best route to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src = &#34;/img/seniordesign/proposal.PNG&#34; width = &#34;1000&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above is a rough outline of what our testing apparatus will look like. Before
fully implementing our design we need to prove that the system will work,
which is why a large, ground-dwelling mount will have to be used initially.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MIT Lincoln Laboratory Intern Innovative Idea Challenge - Final Round - First Place&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MIT Lincoln Laboratory Intern Innovative Idea Challenge - Round Two - Best Poster Award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ENVOY is a system that will allow  natural-language communication between ASL
and non-ASL users. This is done by translating ASL to English, and then English
back to ASL. Applications that are in development today try to focus on
translating ASL to spoken or written English and stop there. This project is
intended to &amp;lsquo;complete the circuit&amp;rsquo; by translating the non-ASL user&amp;rsquo;s response
into ASL. We are proposing this idea because ASL speakers prefer to communicate
in, well, ASL!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two biggest challenges facing ASL translation are the lack of large datasets
to train systems and unreliable language models. In this project, we propose two
solutions that can help alleviate this problems and allow two-way communication
for deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is a part of the &amp;lsquo;Intern Innovative Idea Challenge&amp;rsquo; (I3C) that is
done during the summer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Projects are proposed to
laboratory staff to decide which get funded and added to development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src = &#34;/img/envoy/team_photo.jpg&#34; width = &#34;1000&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyones hard work, we were able to secure funding to continue
creating this system for MIT Lincoln Laboratory!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wind Turbine Impact on Air Surveillance Radar (ASR)</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/windfarm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interference from wind turbines can degrade the performance of radar by providing
a large cross section and Doppler signal.  Further, wind farms generally contain
turbines that are spaced close together. All of these factors contribute to
pockets of poor radar performance near wind farms and is a concern for flight
safety.  As the investment in wind energy increases it is important to understand
the potential impact of these farms on legacy radar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HARA: Hybrid Analog-digital Retro-directive Antenna</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/retrodirective/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/retrodirective/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project&amp;rsquo;s primary objective is to create an IC capable of retro-
directive beamforming in a phased antena array system. This allows the
antenna to automatically point in the direction of the strongest signal
instead of spending time on beam steering techniques. Further, we can
create interesting configurations of the array for different applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am assisting a graduate student to test this design by measuring the
timing charecteristics of the system. Currently the IC design is being
optimized and fabricated with testing slated for Fall 2019. I have assisted
in charecterizing capacitor crystals for the IC using a FieldFox Spectrum
Analyze as well as designed a testing apparatus for the transmitter /
receiver. I was also able to begin soldering some of the components down
for one of the testing boards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Radar Vulnerability Testing</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/radar_vulnerability/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently working for the defense contractor Dynetics Inc. to investigate ways of
&amp;lsquo;hacking&amp;rsquo; an army provided phased array radar via hardware vulnerabilities. Current
tasks include emulating the radar hardware environment and investigating pathways
to attack the system, both from standoff distance and from an operational perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>eMotes: Novel Disposable Airborne Probes</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/emote/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/emote/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and GlobalSense partnered
to sponsor the eMote in order to take measurements from the atmosphere.
Data is streamed from an ensemble of sensors (up to 2080) to receivers
located on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src = &#34;/img/emote/emote.png&#34; width = &#34;1000&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system provides data on temperature, humidity, altitude, GPS, and
inertial measurements from the atmosphere. The receiver&amp;rsquo;s hardware consists
of the Tiva-C Launchpad and TI-MSP430. TI-RTOS (Texas Instruments Real-Time
Operating System) is used in order to wield excellent interrupt driven IO
from the antenna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src = &#34;/img/emote/system.png&#34; width = &#34;1000&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project has been ongoing since I have been an undergraduate at Auburn.
Currently I assist in testing the system, focussing primarily on the
receiver end of the project. We most recently concluded range and battery
testing. Future work consists of pulling wind vectors from the sensors as
well as measuring resonant frequencies of static structures.&lt;/p&gt;
