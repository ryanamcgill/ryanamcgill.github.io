      <title>ENVOY: Enabling Natural-language Versatility and Opportunity</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/envoy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t say too much about this project! ENVOY is a system that will allow
natural-language communication between ASL and non-ASL users. This is done by
translating ASL to English, and then English back to ASL. Applications that
are in development today try to focus on translating ASL to spoken or written
English and stop there. This project is intended to &amp;lsquo;complete the circuit&amp;rsquo; by
translating the non-ASL user&amp;rsquo;s response into ASL. We are proposingthis idea
because ASL speakers prefer to communicate in, well, ASL!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is a part of the &amp;lsquo;Intern Innovative Idea Challenge&amp;rsquo; (I3C) that is
done during the summer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Currently the project has
passed the first round (staff voting) and is participating in the
second round (poster presentation).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wind Turbine Impact on Air Surveillance Radar (ASR)</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/windfarm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t say too much about this project! Each year countries put up more and
more wind turbines that are only growing in size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacy radars are being impacted as wind turbine blades happen to have
similar radar cross sections as target aircraft. The spinning of these blades
gives a doppler return at the radar site. Further, wind farms generally
contain turbines that are spaced close together. All of these factors contribute
to pockets of low probability of detection and tracking which translates to
potential &amp;lsquo;holes&amp;rsquo; in air surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HARA: Hybrid Analog-digital Retro-directive Antenna</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/retrodirective/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/retrodirective/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project&amp;rsquo;s primary objective is to create an IC capable of retro-
directive beamforming in a phased antena array system. This allows the
antenna to automatically point in the direction of the strongest signal
instead of spending time on beam steering techniques. Further, we can
create interesting configurations of the array for different applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am assisting a graduate student to test this design by measuring the
timing charecteristics of the system. Currently the IC design is being
optimized and fabricated with testing slated for Fall 2019. I have assisted
in charecterizing capacitor crystals for the IC using a FieldFox Spectrum
Analyze as well as designed a testing apparatus for the transmitter /
receiver. I was also able to begin soldering some of the components down
for one of the testing boards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Radar Vulnerability Testing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t say too much about this project! Currently working for the defense
contractor Dynetics Inc. to investigate ways of &amp;lsquo;hacking&amp;rsquo; an army provided
phased array radar via hardware vulnerabilities. Current tasks include emulating the
radar hardware environment and investigating pathways to attack the system,
both from standoff distance and from an operational perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>eMotes: Novel Disposable Airborne Probes</title>
      <link>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/emote/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ryanamcgill.github.io/project/emote/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and GlobalSense partnered
to sponsor the eMote in order to take measurements from the atmosphere.
Data is streamed from an ensemble of sensors (up to 2080) to receivers
located on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src = &#34;/img/emote/emote.png&#34; width = &#34;1000&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system provides data on temperature, humidity, altitude, GPS, and
inertial measurements from the atmosphere. The receiver&amp;rsquo;s hardware consists
of the Tiva-C Launchpad and TI-MSP430. TI-RTOS (Texas Instruments Real-Time
Operating System) is used in order to wield excellent interrupt driven IO
from the antenna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src = &#34;/img/emote/system.png&#34; width = &#34;1000&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project has been ongoing since I have been an undergraduate at Auburn.
Currently I assist in testing the system, focussing primarily on the
receiver end of the project. We most recently concluded range and battery
testing. Future work consists of pulling wind vectors from the sensors as
well as measuring resonant frequencies of static structures.&lt;/p&gt;
